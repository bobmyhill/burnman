Equilibrium composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In any equilibrium problem at constant bulk composition with :math:`m` endmembers, we have :math:`m+2` unknowns, which are the compositions and amounts of the phases, and the pressure and temperature of the reaction. In order to solve such problems, a set of :math:`m+2` equations is required.


Consider the :math:`m` x :math:`n` stoichiometric matrix :math:`\textbf{A}` where the :math:`m` rows correspond to the set of endmembers, and the :math:`n` columns correspond to the elements contained within those compounds. We're interested in finding the set of independent reactions between the endmembers which do not change the bulk composition, i.e., the set of vectors contained within the left nullspace:

.. math::
   \mathcal{N}(\textbf{A}^T) = \{ \textbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m \, : \, \textbf{A}^T \textbf{y} = 0 \}

As will become clear later on, it is also useful to consider the set of vectors orthogonal to the left nullspace, which are known as the column space of A:

.. math::
   \mathcal{R}(\textbf{A}) = \{ \textbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m \, : \, \textbf{A}^T \textbf{y} \neq 0 \}


We can find the column space and left null space of :math:`\textbf{A}` by singular value decomposition:

.. math::
   \textbf{A} = \textbf{U} \Sigma \textbf{V}^T

where :math:`\textbf{U}` is an :math:`m` x :math:`m` matrix, :math:`\textbf{V}` is an :math:`n` x :math:`n` matrix, and :math:`\Sigma` is a :math:`m` x :math:`n` diagonal matrix where the diagonal entries are known as singular values. The left nullspace corresponds to the rows of :math:`U^T` with singular values equal to zero. 


Now that we have these m vectors, we can use them to set up an equilibrium relation. The equilibrium relation must hold for all the reactions described by the left nullspace. For each reaction, the equilibrium relation states that

.. math::
   0 = \sum_i n_i \left( \mathcal{G}_i + RT \ln \alpha_i \right)

For a pure phase, the activity :math:`\alpha` is equal to 1. A second requirement is that the bulk composition must not change. For this to be true, the compositional vector :math:`X` must satisfy the following relationship

.. math::
   0 = \mathcal{R}(\textbf{A}) \left( X - X_0 \right)

where :math:`X_0` is any initial guess which satisfies the bulk composition. These two requirements yield m reactions. Two further equations are required to solve for the :math:`m+2` unknowns, which may be constraints on the pressure, temperature or compositions of the phases.





Chemical potentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




Averaging schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the properties of multiphase composites are simple arithmetic averages/sums of the properties of the individual phases. This is true, for example, of the Gibbs free energy and volume of aggregate materials:

.. math::
    \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{system}}= \sum_i n_i \mathcal{G}_i,
    :label: gibbstotal

.. math::
    V = \sum_i n_i V_i,
    :label: composite_volume

.. math::
    \rho = \sum_i \nu_i \rho_i = \frac{1}{V}\sum_i {n_i \mu_i}
    :label: composite_density

Unlike density and volume, the bulk and shear moduli of a multiphase rock are dependent on the shape, orientation and texture of the individual phases. We first define the volume fraction of the individual minerals in an assemblage:

.. math::
    \nu_i = n_i \frac{V_i}{V},

where :math:`V_i` and :math:`n_i` are the molar volume and the molar fractions of the :math:`i` th individual phase. BurnMan allows several schemes for averaging the elastic moduli: the Voigt and Reuss bounds, the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds, the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average, and the Hashin-Shtrikman average :cite:`Watt1976`.

The Voigt average, assuming constant strain across all phases, is defined as

.. math::
    X_V = \sum_i \nu_i X_i,
    :label: voigt

where :math:`X_i` is the bulk or shear modulus for the :math:`i` th phase.
The Reuss average, assuming constant stress across all phases, is defined as

.. math::
    X_R = \left(\sum_i \frac{\nu_i}{X_i} \right)^{-1}.
    :label: reuss

The Voigt-Reuss-Hill average is the arithmetic mean of Voigt and Reuss bounds:

.. math::
    X_{VRH} = \frac{1}{2} \left( X_V + X_R \right).
    :label: vrh

The Hashin-Shtrikman bounds make an additional assumption that the distribution of the phases is statistically isotropic and are usually much narrower than the Voigt and Reuss bounds :cite:`Watt1976`.
This may be a poor assumption in regions of Earth with high anisotropy, such as the lowermost mantle, however these bounds are more physically motivated than the commonly-used Voigt-Reuss-Hill average.
In most instances, the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average and the arithmetic mean of the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds are quite similar with the pure arithmetic mean (linear averaging) being well outside of both.

It is worth noting that each of the above bounding methods are derived from mechanical models of a linear elastic composite.
It is thus only appropriate to apply them to elastic moduli, and not to other thermoelastic properties, such as wave speeds or density.



Computing seismic velocities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the moduli for the multiphase assemblage are computed, the compressional (:math:`P`), shear (:math:`S`) and bulk sound (:math:`\Phi`)
velocities are then result from the equations:


.. math::
    V_P = \sqrt{ \frac{K_S + \frac{4}{3} G} {\rho} }, \qquad
    V_S = \sqrt{ \frac{G}{\rho} }, \qquad
    V_\Phi = \sqrt{ \frac{K_S}{\rho} }.
    :label: seismic

To correctly compare to observed seismic velocities one needs to correct for the frequency sensitivity of attenuation.
Moduli parameters are obtained from experiments that are done at high frequencies (MHz-GHz) compared to seismic frequencies (mHz-Hz).
The frequency sensitivity of attenuation causes slightly lower velocities for seismic waves than they would be for high frequency waves.
In BurnMan one can correct the calculated acoustic velocity values to those for long period seismic tomography :cite:`Minster1981`:

.. math::
    V_{S/P}=V_{S/P}^{\mathrm{uncorr.}}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\cot(\frac{\beta\pi}{2})\frac{1}{Q_{S/P}}(\omega)\right).

Similar to :cite:`Matas2007`, we use a :math:`\beta` value of 0.3, which falls in the range of values of :math:`0.2` to :math:`0.4` proposed for the lower mantle (e.g. :cite:`Karato1990`).
The correction is implemented for :math:`Q` values of PREM for the lower mantle.
As :math:`Q_S` is smaller than :math:`Q_P`, the correction is more significant for S waves.
In both cases, though, the correction is minor compared to, for example, uncertainties in the temperature (corrections) and mineral physical parameters.
More involved models of relaxation mechanisms can be implemented, but lead to the inclusion of more poorly constrained parameters, :cite:`Matas2007a`.
While attenuation can be ignored in many applications :cite:`Trampert2001`, it might play a significant role in explaining strong variations in seismic velocities in the lowermost mantle :cite:`Davies2012`.
