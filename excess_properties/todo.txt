#DONE# Dependent endmembers - Same logic as in Diener, but with F(V, T) instead of G(P, T)
#DONE# Pyroxene text - Describe, emphasize non-ideality, good approximation with only one variable (pressure)
Garnet - Compare bulk moduli, volumes to Du study, write up.
Bridgmanite - K', look at Vanpeteghem results to 10 GPa for pure MgSiO3, excess volume in MgSi--AlAl?
#NOT A GOOD IDEA# Melts - Fort + Moore processing ... find DP that fits volume, then look at the bulk modulus misfit.


Discussion:
How important is the effect?
