# Still to do
- Use analytical derivatives for dV/dP, dV/dT and dS/dT
- We need something to account for the reactions in ASPECT. Not clear how to do this with a compositionally variable system.
- Possibly we also need to ensure that melt is always stable for numerical reasons. We did this in the ULVZ paper by considering a volatile component that was only stable in the melt. We could do the same thing here if it was necessary?
