## Companion code to
# An anisotropic equation of state for solid solutions and minerals undergoing phase transitions

The python scripts contained in this directory accompany a paper
being prepared by Myhill (2022).
There are comments in each of the scripts, so it is hoped that by reading
these in tandem with the original paper, the reader will get a feel
for how to use the code for their own purposes.

The scripts contained in this directory are as follows:
