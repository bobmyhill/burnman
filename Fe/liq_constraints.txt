From Hixson

rho a   Kt
5.7 115 35  40
7.1 90  90  81

thus aKT decreases strongly with temperature at 1 bar

gruneisen somewhat curved with density
sound speeds linear with density (see Birch)

K_S/rho = phi^2 ~ c*rho^2
K_S ~ c*rho^3


C_V roughly linear with rho, intercept at 0 kg/m^3


One easy solution would be to take the energy, volume and bulk modulus data at 1 bar, assume some K' (or fix it), and then extrapolate up-pressure.
Simple, but given the lack of data, I don't see anything else being much better.


bulk modulus could be obtained from
K_T = (gamma*Cv)/(alpha*V)

gamma could be obtained from
gamma = alpha*K_S*V/Cp
