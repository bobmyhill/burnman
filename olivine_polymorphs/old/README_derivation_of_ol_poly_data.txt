WADSLEYITE
Fitting the Ye et al. thermal expansion data gives exactly the same a0 as found in ds62, but with a slightly larger V0 (4.056 instead of 4.051). H was decreased slightly to counteract the change. S was not changed.

RINGWOODITE
The bulk modulus was increased to 185 GPa and the K' to 4.4, as found in Li (2003) and Higo et al., (2006).

The ds62 mrw results in a very wide wad-rw binary loop, inconsistent with Frost (2003). The problem probably stems from a small thermal expansion - the ancient data on is smaller than that of Inoue (2004) and Ye et al. (2009). The Inoue data is rubbish.

A least squares inversion of the Ye et al. data (0.2 wt % H2O) yields the following:
a0:  2.4515042928e-05 +/- 3.66518346375e-07 GPa
V0:  3.94932992518 +/- 0.000525636562004 kJ/kbar

The small amount of water in the ringwoodite structure is insufficient to have a measurable effect on a0.

To obtain this value, it was necessary to iteratively refit H0, S0 to fit the Katsura and Ito (1989) wad-rw reaction line. 
G0 = -2151300 and S0 = 96 provide an excellent fit to the data.

FERRORINGWOODITE
G tweaked to fit reaction with fayalite (Frost, 2003) and also the data of Woodland.

FERROWADSLEYITE
V0 was changed to fit Woodland data.

There is a tradeoff between H0 and W(mwd,fwd). Using the value of W used by Frost (2003; 15 kJ/mol) stabilised fwd at 1400C, so a slightly smaller value was adopted (13 kJ/mol). This allowed fitting of H0 to match the fo-fa phase diagram at 1400C, by also tweaking W(mrw,frw) to a slightly lower value (7 kJ/mol). Both of these values are within the errors reported by Frost (2003).  

The metastable continuation of the wad-fa <-> wad boundary in the ferric - ferrous system from Woodland and Angel (2000) is in good agreement with the metastable reaction of fa to fwd. It should be noted that the boundary is strongly curved, something which is hard to recreate with a symmetric regular solution model. An asymmetric model may be required.
