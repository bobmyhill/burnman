example_calibrants
------------------

This example demonstrates the use of BurnMan's library of pressure calibrants.
These calibrants are stripped-down versions of BurnMan's minerals, in that
they are only designed to return pressure as a function of
volume and temperature or volume as a function of pressure and temperature.

*Uses:*

* :class:`burnman.classes.calibrant.Calibrant`
* :func:`burnman.calibrants.tools.pressure_to_pressure`
* Decker (1971) calibration for NaCl

*Demonstrates:*

* Use of the Calibrant class
* Conversion between pressures given by two different calibrations.

    # in m^3/mol, you can use the BurnMan tool
